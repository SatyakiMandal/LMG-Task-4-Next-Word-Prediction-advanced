Ooh
Pretty face with two sides
So what's it gonna be tonight?
Dark days, I'm terrified
I know that something isn't right
You take what you want
Then you leave when you're done
Pretty face with two sides
So what's it gonna be tonight?
I'm in my house in the hills with The Reaper
And I wonder if he knows what I've done
I got the keys and I'm going off the deep end
Doesn't hurt when you're doin' it for fun
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Am I in your
Ah
I pull the trigger just to show her that I need her
But she don't really trust anyone
Yeah, everybody's always lookin' for a feature
No one's steppin' up to be the one
Am I in your way-ay-ay? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Family
I know water that's thicker than blood
That's deeper than love with my friends
People come and some people go
And some people ride 'til the end
When I am blind, in my mind
I swear they'd be my rescue, my lifeline
I don't know what I'd do if I, if I'd survive
My brothers and my sisters in my life, yeah
I know some people, they would die for me
We run together, they're my family
When I get up, they gon' be high with me
I'll say forever, my family
Family
I'll say forever, my family
Family
I'll say forever, my family
Stolen dreams took our, our childish days
Still, ain't nothin' changed, now we're grown
We're still young, still got our mindless ways
In a timeless phase, kickin' stones
When I am blind, in my mind
I swear they'd be my rescue, my lifeline
I don't know what I'd do if I, if I'd survive
My brothers and my sisters in my life, yeah

I go from Okay, I'm okay to I'm not okay in .2
I go from cool in my new place to packin' my suitcase like you
I said it over and over that I wouldn't do this
Go find someone new and just fuck my way through this
But no way, oh, no way I'm okay when thinkin' 'bout you
You were right when you said it, keep my cards to my chest
And I never let no one know me, I pushed you out
Now I get that you needed just a little more love
And to just see me wide open and breaking down
When no one's there to listen, I will hear your pain
I know that I was less than, but you know people change
So tell me, what's the difference if we still feel the same?
It takes a little distance to make you see the way
I go from Okay, I'm okay to  I'm not okay 
From Okay, I'm okay to I'm not okay 
From Okay, I'm okay to I'm not okay 
From Okay, I'm okay to I'm not o

From Okay, I'm okay, I'm not o, I'm not o 
Deleted your photos, don't know what I thought it would do
And I know what you're thinkin', that's never something I would do
I wish I could lie, but I'm so not a liar
Been trying to try to pretend that I'm fine
But I just end up lying here, feeling more than I want to
You were right when you said it, keep my cards to my chest
And I never let no one know me, I pushed you out
Now I get that you needed just a little more love
And to just see me wide open and breaking down
When no one's there to listen, I will hear your pain

Welcome home, how's your summer been?
I heard you moved in with your boyfriend in New York
What's his name? I heard he works downtown in finance
Is he just as good at romance as we were?
Okay, enough, P.S. I hope you're happy
I started acting out when you moved on
I tried to call you to eliminate the distance
I cared about you once and always will
And I tried my best, crossed my fingers for the rest
And I will find a way, somehow
To be more than photos to you now
I blame myself for when I was someone else
I might not get over this
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope...

P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope...
P.S. I hope you're...
What the hell? I couldn't help but check your phone
Who the fuck is "Drew from home" anyway?
This vacation, you said, "Going home was boring"
Left out that part of the story on your way
I might deserve it, but I can't take it
Maybe I should keep this to myself
'Cause if I'm honest, my record's less than flawless
You know that I get lonely when you're gone
And I tried my best, crossed my fingers for the rest
And I will find a way, somehow
To be more than photos to you now
I blame myself for when I was someone else
I might not get over this
But I won't be sad for the sake of it
P.S. I hope you're... P.S. I hope...

Two kids with their hearts on fire
Who's gonna save us now?
When we thought that we couldn't get higher
Things started looking down
I look at you and you look at me
Like nothing but strangers now
Two kids with their hearts on fire
Don't let it burn us out
Think about what you believe in now
Am I someone you cannot live without?
'Cause I know I don't wanna live without you, yeah
Come on, let's turn this all around
Bring it all back to that bar downtown
When you wouldn't let me walk out on you, yeah
You said, "Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?"
And I said, "I don't even know what I'm doing tonight"
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
So I call you mine
Ooh, ah, ooh
Can I call you mine? Ooh
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
Broke kids running through the city
Drunk on the subway train
Set free every time you kissed me
We couldn't feel no pain
You looked at me and I looked at you
Like we'd never look away
Broke kids running through the city
Don't let the memory fade
You said, "Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?"
And I said, "I don't even know what I'm doing tonight"
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
So I call you mine
Ooh, ah, ooh

Made plans with me and all your friends
I'm late again, I hate to keep you waiting
Tried to be a gentleman, got drunk again before I even made it
Tried to call a car for you, you're tired of me
I know you wouldn't take it
You walked a mile in Louis Vuittons and fucked 'em up
You know that they're my favorite
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Arguments that never end
You're talkin' shit to spice up conversation
I'm so sick of back and forth
These fights with you are startin' to feel contagious
Said that I'm no good for you
Right before we walk into your parents
Then you put on that smile again
And grab my hand even though you hate it
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
